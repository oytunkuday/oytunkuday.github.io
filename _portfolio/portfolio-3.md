excerpt: "We produce the first English Louvre Dataset and investigate how effectively NLP models understand art-related text by curating and annotating a cultural-heritage corpus (Van Dyke’s painting textbook, translated Louvre records, etc.), defining a BRAT schema (entities, relations, events), and fine‑tuning DistilBERT for NER. Results show strong performance and qualitative reasoning on museum-style queries.<br/><a href='/files/NLP_Term_Project.pdf'>Paper (PDF)</a><br/><img class='portfolio-thumb' src='/images/louvre.png' alt='Cultural-heritage NLP project'>"

This project evaluates whether NLP models can understand and reason over art-domain texts.
We built a domain-specific dataset by:

- Curating and annotating text from A Text‑Book of the History of Painting and translated Louvre metadata
- Designing a BRAT annotation schema with entities, relations, and events
- Converting annotations to CoNLL for training and evaluation

We fine‑tuned DistilBERT for named entity recognition and performed qualitative inference to
assess interpretive capabilities in museum and art‑history contexts.
