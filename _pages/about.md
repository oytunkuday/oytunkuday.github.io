Hi!

I am a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am from Istanbul, Turkey and I have received my undergraduate degrees (CS,EE) in Sabanci University. Some of my hobbies include photography, diving, camping, gaming, art, hiking.

My research interests include systems, architecture, and machine learning.

Currently, I am working on system/transformer-level optimizations on LLMs to reduce memory footprint.
